I know u'll read the 'commit' time so i have to upload this file, just to clarify:
+ Sometimes I'll fix my file directly in GitHub, this is my place and I have permission with this, so if you think I turn in my work late, check the commit history!
+ I'll do the same thing I 've just told up above with my upcoming work, if necessary.
+ To avoid misunderstanding, I'll create a copy file, which every errors (if occured in my last work) had been fixed.
